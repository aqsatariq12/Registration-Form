This Registration form is crafted using a combination of HTML and CSS. The styling for this form is implemented using both internal and inline CSS, ensuring a clean and structured design. The internal CSS is used to define broader styling rules within the <style> section of the HTML document, while inline CSS is applied directly to specific elements for precise control over their appearance. This approach allows for a cohesive and visually appealing user experience
